<h1>Hi, welcome to DigitalGlasses!</h1>

<h2>Ver 1.1</h2>
<p>We've just upgraded DigitalGlasses to version 1.1 and added some exciting new features!</p>

<h3>Here's what's new in 1.1:</h3>
<ul>
  <li><b>User Registration</b>: Now, everyone can start their own blog on DigitalGlasses! We've added a user registration function, so go ahead and create your own account.</li>
  <li><b>Secure Login/Logout</b>: Once you've registered, you can securely log in to your blog. When you're done, you can easily log out again.</li>
  <li><b>Author Authorization</b>: Your blog is your kingdom. Only you, the owner, can add, edit, or delete posts on your blog.</li>
  <li><b>User Directory</b>: Check out the community! On the homepage, you'll find a list of all users. Go ahead and explore their blogs!</li>
  <li><b>Public Profiles</b>: Each user's blog can be accessed at <code>website_address.com/:username</code>. Here, you'll find all their posts. And the best part? Even non-logged-in users can view any user's blog page.</li>
</ul>

<h3>And, of course, we've kept all the cool features from version 1.0:</h3>
<ul>
  <li><b>Admin Dashboard</b>: Run the show from behind the scenes. Add, edit, or say goodbye to any blog posts. It's all up to you, chief!</li>
  <li><b>Killer Main Webpage</b>: Your site's gonna look slick, showcasing your name, avatar, and all your rad blog posts. Plus, a top menu and footer because, well, who doesn't love a good footer?</li>
  <li><b>User Login Magic</b>: We're using bcrypt and jsonwebtoken to make sure your stuff is secure. Only you get the keys to the kingdom, pal!</li>
</ul>
