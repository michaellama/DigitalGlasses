<h1>Hi welcome to DigitalGlasses !</h1>

<h2>Ver 1.0</h2>
So, what's the deal here? Well, we're cookin' up a pretty sweet blogging platform. It's currently in its rookie phase, version 1.0, but it's already rockin' some cool features!

<h3>Here's what we got so far:</h3>
<ul>
  <li><b>User Login Magic</b>: We're using bcrypt and jsonwebtoken to make sure your stuff is secure. Only you get the keys to the kingdom, pal!</li>
  <li><b>Admin Dashboard</b>: Run the show from behind the scenes. Add, edit, or say goodbye to any blog posts. It's all up to you, chief!</li>
<li><b>Killer Main Webpage</b>: Your site's gonna look slick, showcasing your name, avatar, and all your rad blog posts. Plus, a top menu and footer because, well, who doesn't love a good footer?</li>
  <li><b>Oh, and we're just getting started.</b> Our big brains have plans for this baby. Think e-commerce, booking systems, and way more custom options.</li>
</ul>
